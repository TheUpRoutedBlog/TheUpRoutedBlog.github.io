When I first googled 'Camping in Sikkim', a lot of tour operators, packages and references to the famous 'Goechala' trek came up, but nnot that much information on doing anything independantly. These few days were put together with help of our bible Lonley planet, which contains detailed information on a days walk between Yuksom and Tashiding, and a British man who grew up in Darjeeling and Kolkata. There are many alternative variations. If you would prefer to be based in ne place and do day/ overnight walks, Yuksom is a far better place to do this than Pelling. There are a lot 

SIKKIM PERMITS

There is quite a lot of information about these online, the whole process is very straigh forward and takes about an hour. We got ours in Darjeeling which entailed going to the Foreign registration office (opposite SBI) to fill out a form and then taking this to the magistrates court about 500m past the Bus station towards Happy Valley Tea Estate. ALthough research informed us we needed photos and passport copies these were not required.  

GETTING TO PELLING   

If you are coming from Darjeeling, it is worth bearing in mind that even though Pelling is only 30km away, the road is frustratingly closed to foriegners - you will need to first go to another town such as Gantok. There are also  direct shared Jeeps that leave from Silliguri and take about 5 hours. We decided to take the 8am shared jeep from Darjeeling to Gantok (4 hours). We arrived in time to get the 1:15pm Jeep to Pelling, however this was reserved in advance. Luckily we found 4 Australian tourists to share the costs of a private hire (500 rupees per head is a good deal although double the price of the government sponsered Jeeps). This journey also takes 5 hours. If you have no onward travel booked it may be best to budget into your plans an extra 'Transit' night wherever you decide to stop on your way to Yuksom/Pelling, although in high season you may be able to chance bumping into some fellow people heading in your direction. There are a lot of places to stay in Gantok, but its definitely not the nicest to linger.   	


<b> DAY 1: PELLING TO KACHEPERI LAKE <b>

After a night in Hotel Garuda (a Lonely Planet reccmmendation that was fine if very cold and a bit damp) we left at around 9am for the lake. There are a lot of hotels in Pelling, and not much else apart from epic views of Mnt Kanchjunga. See the mountain and move on. Like I said, Yuksom or Tashiding are much nicer towns in which to linger. All the hotels offer overpriced food. 

The walk starts towards the lower end of town, about 200m down from 'Father Travels' there is a shortcut to the Lake. This takes you don't steep steps through Cardaomn fields right to the bottom of the valley, where you cross the river via a bridge. The long way will follow the road, which is a much steadier decline but boring and full of switch backs. on the other side of the river, we followed the road up and around the valley; there are probably other scenic short cuts you can take if you ask around the locals (the English in Sikkim is very good). We got to the lake around 2:00pm - at first it was quite busy with day-trippers but it was very quiet by about 2:30pm. The guesthouse on the hill overlooking the lake (there's a sign on the right before you reach the steps to the pier) let us camp in their grounds for free and helped us build a fire to keep off the wintery chill. They don't have too much available camping space at the moment, maybe two two man tents (?) but they are in the process of building a garden. our Aussie compadres stayed in the guesthouse for 300 rupees per room and said it was fine. The guy was really great and full of information about local walks you could do to different viewpoints in the area. He also provided an excellent Thali for 100 rupees and a hearty breakfast for the next day.  


<b> DAY 2: KACHEPERY LAKE TO HOONGRI GOMPA <b>

We packed up the tent early to get stated on what was supposed to be our longest day. From the Lake to Yuksom takes about 3.5 hours and is fairly similar to the day before: lots of quick downhill paths followed by long uphill roads. When you reach the sign for Yuksom, bear in mind that it's still 3km to the town. Yuksom is really nice with some great temples and monastries - a great base but not really designed for camping. We had lunch there and brought provisions and continued further. We planned to start the Lonely Planet Yuksom - Tashiding walk, first climbing up to Dubdi Gompa, a monastry half an hours climb at the other end of Sikkim by the health centre. We walked through the monastry and came down a path to the right just after a make-shift football pitch. If you're not sure about directions at any time, just ask somebody - they are happy to help. Once you get down to the road, follow it round to Tsong, a very small village. At the end of the village there are some stone steps which lead to a path up the hill. I can only describe these paths as they look like paths to monastries and almost always climb upwards. This one is particularly nice through cardamn fields. We reached Hoongri Gompa at dusk and set up or tent with the permission of the residents. There is also a homestay there if camping is not your thing. The family there would not accept any money and even made us tea to warm ourselves up in the morning, however a small donation to the development of the monastry would be appreciated. 

 
<b> DAY 3: HOONGRI GOMPA TO TASHIDING<b>

If you follow the instructions in Lonely Planet, this section of the walk should be very straight forward, predominantly downhill and take about 4-5 hours with a stop at Soonim monastry. Then, you could have an after nooon to explore Tashiding monastry annd the surrounding area. This is not what we did. A charming local lad took on on a more interesting path, which lead to where his Grandfather was tending sheep. He was very happy to chat to us and we had tea and breakfast with his family before trying and failing  to milk their sheep. He then took us to the road and we parted him to his home and us to Tashiding, which he said was half an hour away. It was not. The locals are awfullfy helpful, however, time and distance is not always accruate. Walking time to the same place could be 1, 2 or 5 hours depending on who you ask. It turned out that wwe were on the wrong road and 9 km away when we got to the right road at that. We knew we were back on track with the Lonely Planet suggested walk when we reached Soonim monastry. From hear there is a start of multiple shrtcuts down to Tashiding through the forest with are a bit hard on the knees but get you there much faster than the road and feel more 'Trekky'. Follow the path down from the monastry, cross the road and slihtly to the left there is another path down. Repeat a few times. making sure you keep to the general direction of Tashiding (2 hours). We decided to 


<b> DAY 4:TASHIDING BACK TO PELLING <b>

Unfortunatley there is no way of doing a complete circle. You can either go back a similar rute to the one you came or take the 37km road
