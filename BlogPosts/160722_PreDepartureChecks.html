  New passport? Check. Rucksacks? Check? Simultaneously not enough stuff and too much stuff in rucksacks? Check. Vaccines and medication? 
  Close enough. Visas? Under control. Practice blog post? In progress… 
  <br>
  <br>

  So, we’ve decided to jump on the travel blog bandwagon. We know, we’re a few years behind the times; bet you’re thinking ‘Oh great, yet 
  another entitled gap-yah how-to guide’ –<i>groans</i>. We sincerely hope you’re wrong, but you can be the judge of that.  
  <br>
  <br>

  We’re a pretty simple concept really - one boy, one girl and one mouse are going to attempt to get to Australia overland, visiting all the
  countries we can along the way.  Think Charley Boorman’s ‘By Any Means’ series, minus the camera crew, dollar and preparation. ‘By Any 
  Means’, as well as Charley’s other incredible adventures with Ewan McGregor, have definitely been our inspiration and slight obsession 
  over the last couple of years.  You know when you watch something on TV and think ‘Yeah, what’s the big deal, I could so do that!’ Well, 
  that’s the conversation we had. We just took it a little bit further than perhaps a sane person would and now here we are with less than 
  a week to go before we leave!
  <br>
  <br>

  Saturday is the big day, and boy are we not ready. The brains of the couple thought it’d be a brilliant idea to depart the UK less than 
  24 hours after finishing the last proper work we’d do for at least 6 months. Definitely not the smartest idea we’ve ever had. But we’re 
  not pretending to be travel experts here - this trip, this blog, this everything is 100% a learn-on-the-job deal and we wouldn’t have it 
  any other way. Of course, Chedder (the mouse, obviously) regards himself as a somewhat travel connoisseur, but feel free to ignore him 
  and his lavish ways. We basically just want to document some of the interesting and exciting things we will be lucky enough to 
  experience, and maybe you can learn along with us. There will be things that go really well (fingers crossed) and definitely absolute 
  disaters. But you can help us differentiate between those disasters we never want to go through again and those which will become our 
  favourite stories in the future.
  <br>
  <br>

  So, feel free to check up on us when you like - we plan to post weekly, so if I were you I’d expect an entry every fortnight. We’ll try 
  our best to keep you informed with any of our discoveries, adventures, funny stories etc., as well as those of other people we might meet 
  along the way.
  <br>
  <br>

  Hasta luego amigos! Next blog post will most certainly be written from somewhere a little more exotic than this dining room table.
